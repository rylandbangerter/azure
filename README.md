The Moving from Jira to Azure DevOps project was a key initiative during my internship at In Time Tec, where I played an integral role in transitioning project data between two major project management platforms. The goal was to migrate essential project files, tickets, and associated data from Jira to Azure DevOps to improve team collaboration and project tracking.

To achieve this, I analyzed the structural differences between Jira and Azure DevOps, including how each platform organizes data such as user stories, tasks, and workflows. I worked closely with the team to identify the best methods for ensuring compatibility and avoiding data loss during the migration.

Using **Python** and **Java**, I developed automation scripts to extract data from Jira, transform it as needed, and upload it into Azure DevOps. This process involved writing code to handle APIs for both platforms, validating the integrity of transferred data, and troubleshooting issues such as formatting mismatches or failed uploads. I also ensured the metadata (e.g., timestamps, user assignments, and project statuses) was preserved accurately.

Key contributions and challenges I addressed included:
- Writing reusable Python scripts to handle batch data exports and imports.
- Debugging API errors and ensuring compliance with each platformâ€™s data schemas.
- Collaborating with teammates to test and verify the success of the migration process.
- Managing deadlines and organizing work to meet project milestones efficiently.

This experience significantly strengthened my technical skills, particularly in scripting, API integration, and data transformation. It also enhanced my teamwork and communication abilities, as I worked closely with stakeholders to understand their requirements and ensure a smooth migration process. The project provided valuable insight into the importance of automation and efficiency in managing large-scale transitions for enterprise tools.
